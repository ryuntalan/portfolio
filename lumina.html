            In an international survey of 2285 remote workers, 71% of managers and employees desire work-from-home options even after the pandemic is over. However, working from home can intrude both physically and psychologically on family time, blurring the boundaries between home and work, and encourages overwork and work preoccupation. <span class="bold">The lack of dedicated workspaces, competing priorities at home, and increase in distractions lead to more mental fatigue and poor mental well-being.</span>

          As we continue to refine our concept, it’s important to establish a design direction so that we're aligned on both the visual and emotional aspect of our product. I led my team through this process by first identifying our brand values. Through a brainstorming session, we generated words that represent our design principles. I then synthesized them into 4 brand values/ attributes: <span class="bold">soothing, harmonious, personal, and approachable.</span> We then dived into creating moodboards that represent those values.

          With the first iteration of our core concept and information architecture set, we begin prototype planning. We defined 3 key paths accompanied by a set of research questions to test with our low-fidelity prototypes. Prototype planning helps with establishing an aligned agenda on what questions we want to answer and helps ensure we’re using our time wisely when creating low-fidelity prototypes. Here are our key paths:

          <ol class="case-numbered-list">
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">More interactive features.</span> Professionals are interested in adding more features to Lumina, like an interactive display, digital sticky notes, and more background display options.
            </li>
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">Concern about screen fatigue.</span> There was concern about fatigue due to light and color from the display. Some thought that moving patterns may be too stimulating, and wanted options to display static pictures of scenic background images instead.
            </li>
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">Better separation.</span> Most were enthusiastic about being able to create their own space/ bubble with better ambience, describing it as a  fancy digital cubicle. One user wondered if it would be claustrophobic.
            </li>
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">Adaptable physical form.</span> Professionals want to customize the physical form of Lumina to use it in a variety of locations in the home. For example, being able to stretch the product to full size or extended on the table.

We will also consider other interactive features that can be enabled by this modular form.</li>
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">Explore interactive features for mental well-being.</span> Many professionals are interested in interacting with the display, such as using it for meetings or as a digital whiteboard. While we can see the utility of these ideas, we are more interested in interactivity as a way to enhance mental well-being over productivity. We will explore using the display for interactive activities for mindfulness, meditation, or relaxation.</li>
            <li class="case-list-item"><span class="bold">Adjust how we present Lumina.</span> We need to emphasize that Lumina is not a digital “screen” similar to a TV or monitor due to concerns about screen fatigue.

        I created the Lumina mobile app design system within Figma. This helped ensure we have a cohesive visual design throughout the interface.

We used Proxima Nova as our primary typeface because of its clean, modern, and friendly look.

        <a class="bold">Ask why often.</a> When designing a product, it’s important to understand the purpose behind a selected design method or design decision. Asking why often ensures that we’re checking the reasoning behind a decision and helps prevent biased/ uninformed/ blind decisions. In addition, by knowing and communicating our reasoning, we can get better feedback on decisions and it can check for assumptions.
