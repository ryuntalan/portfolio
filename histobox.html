            Me and two other team members competed in a 3-day national design
            competition called Adobe Creative Jam LIVE. It's a virtual event
            series where thought leaders share a behind-the-scene peek into
            their processes and projects; meanwhile, teams compete in a
            tournament that puts their creative skills to the test using Adobe
            Creative Cloud.

            My team and I conducted two interviews with teachers to gain a
            deeper understanding of our potential users. We developed a
            questionnaire as a guide for our interview and it was conducted
            through video call. One key question we asked was "If you had an
            application that can help you with anything with teaching, what
            would it do and why?" Some key insights that we gained from this
            question was
            <b>"ensuring that lesson plans align with common core standards"</b>
            and
            <b
              >""something that maintains student engagement and encourages

            We also explored the internet to gain more information on the A&E
            Values (owners of thr HISTORY channel), pain points in teaching
            history, and statistics that correspond to our user needs. One
            interesting statistic that we found was about how student engagement
            drops each school year.

            "The Gallup Student Poll surveyed nearly 500,000 students in grades
            five through 12 from more than 1,700 public schools in 37 states in
            2012. They found that nearly eight in 10 elementary students who
            participated in the poll are engaged with school. By middle school
            that falls to about six in 10 students. And by high school, only
            four in 10 students qualify as engaged (Gallup Student Polls,
