          <p>
          By year-end, we saw a 318% increase in monthly active users and a 110% increase in appointment conversions. Grace also helped deflect 22% of administrative messages and 8% of total MyChart messages.

          <p>In December 2021, I joined the Providence Digital Innovation Group (DIG), a product development team pioneering digital solutions within the Providence health system. Our design team was small—just two designers and a manager.</p>
          <p>One of my first projects was Grace, a click-bot initially created during COVID-19 to answer frequently asked questions.</p>

        <div class="case-description">
          <p>While Grace served its initial purpose as a patient-facing FAQ bot, it wasn’t evolving to meet new challenges:</p>
        </div>

  
        <div class="case-description">
          <p class="case-section-first-bullet-point">Doctors and care teams are burned out by MyChart messages</p>
          30% of messages were administrative (e.g., rescheduling, billing, prescription refills) and didn’t require clinical judgment.
        </div>

        <div class="case-description">
          <p class="case-section-bullet-point">Grace had low visibility and engagement</p>
          The bot was only deployed on a few webpages and had low open rates, meaning most patients never interacted with it.
        </div>

        <div class="case-description">
          <p class="case-section-bullet-point">Grace lacked self-service features</p>
          It only provided static FAQ responses and didn’t integrate with the EHR to support personalized actions like managing medications.
        </div>

        <div class="case-description">
          <p class="case-section-bullet-point">​​The UI was outdated and rigid          </p>
          Designed as a click-bot, Grace prioritized button-based navigation, making text input and natural conversation an afterthought. This led to a restrictive, transactional experience instead of a more engaging and conversational one.        </div>

        <div class="case-description">
          <p class="case-section-bullet-point">Lack of a structured design system slowed iterations
          </p>
          Grace’s design system was non-existent, making design iterations slow and inconsistent.

            <div class="case-description top-space-sm">
              Grace’s UI was limiting: <b>open rates were low, the interaction model was unclear, and the visual design felt outdated.</b> We knew a simple visual refresh wouldn’t be enough—we needed a clear north star to guide not just how Grace looked, but how it delivered value.

            <div class="case-description top-space-sm">
              To shape this direction, I conducted a <b>competitive analysis that helped us align on a tone</b> that felt both professional and approachable—a balance that felt right for healthcare.

              As part of this vision, we also looked for opportunities to improve engagement. At the time, Grace had a <b>1% open rate</b>. During the competitive analysis, I identified a common pattern across high-performing chatbots: a floating shortcut menu that surfaced the bot’s value upfront.

              In September 2022, we launched a pilot with select primary and specialty care clinics to validate Grace’s ability to offer self-service options and reduce the number of messages sent to care teams.

          </a> Product often prioritized growth metrics like monthly active users, while design pushed for long-term vision and experience quality. I learned the value of advocating for both—driving measurable impact in the short term while also shaping the north star experience. Design can (and should) be a source of innovation, not just refinement.
