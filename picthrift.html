          As an introduction to the University of Washingtonâ€™s MHCI+D program, our cohort engaged in a five-day design sprint.

        <div class="case-description">
          <span class="bold">Embrace ambiguity.</span> As a designer, Iâ€™m going to be in many uncharted situations with undefined boundaries. By embracing ambiguity, I accept the challenge to explore the unknown and make sense of what is uncertain. Embracing ambiguity sets the stage for staying flexible. As I continue to navigate through the pandemic and remote work, I look forward to learning from and adapting to the challenges of uncertainty.

        <div class="case-description">
          <span class="bold">Collaborate with multiple perspectives.</span> Shoutout to Leyla and Laura! I greatly appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with them. Throughout the design process, each of us brought a different perspective that allowed us to learn and build on each otherâ€™s ideas. I believe our unique experiences and skills helped us to design a more informed product. In addition, getting critiques from my classmates helped me refine the concepts and understand how to communicate my ideas more clearly.
