          <p>

          Our <b>primary key performance indicator was lab completion rate</b>, which is the percentage of patients who complete their lab orders within a specific timeframe. We tracked both 7-day and 30-day completion to measure short- and longer-term follow-through.

            Document your sad paths and edge cases:
          </a> 
          Leading with the happy path helps drive clarity and momentum, but supporting end-to-end flows means planning for what happens when things don’t go as expected. What if a patient has location services turned off? What if they miss their appointment? Defining these scenarios early helps create a more refined experience.

            Balancing deadlines with impact:
          </a> 
          Meeting deadlines is paramount. However, delivering an experience that best helps patients can override a target date. In this project, we chose to delay launch to include the LabCorp integration, which made the feature significantly more useful. It was a reminder that pushing back a release can be the right call when it leads to better outcomes for patients and care teams.
